# Implementation of Suffix Array Construction Algorithms in Java 7

These codes are implementation of suffix array construction algorithms in Java 7.
The implemented algorithms are following:

1. Manber and Myers
2. Bentley and Sedgewick
3. Larsson and Sadakane
4. Itoh and Tanaka
5. K&auml;rkk&auml;innen and Sanders
6. Ko and Aluru
7. Nong, Zhang and Chan (SA-IS)

Since these are slightly coner-cutting implementation, if you want to use these codes for practical use, I recommend you to use other more smart suffix array libraries.
